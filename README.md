# Gut microbiome and resistome of Galapagos marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) from uninhabited islands
This repository has the bioinformatic pipelines used to analyze the fecal microbiome and resistome of marine iguanas from The Galapagos Islands. Three analyses were done: 16S RNA sequencing (microbiome), SmartChip RT-QPCR (resistome and mobilome), and Shot-gun sequencing (metagenomics).
